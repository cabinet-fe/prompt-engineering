-- 路径纳入检索：documents_fts 增加 path 列（第 5 列），把文档路径（含目录与扩展名）
-- 按同一分词方案预分词后写入，使「文件名 / 路径片段」成为可命中词元——例如 index.md
-- 可被 index 命中、compositions/use-dnd.md 可被 use-dnd 命中。路径是 get 接口的唯一键，
-- 也是使用者的 AI 看得到的文档标识，索引与寻址就此对齐。
-- 存量索引行从 documents.path 就地重建（documents 原文不动，数据不丢）；新推送由写入
-- 路径（write.go）直接写预分词文本。
--
-- 路径的字符级状态机与 tokenize.go 的 tokenize() 对齐，复用 0002 同一套 CTE（CJK 连续段
-- 产出全部单字 + 相邻二元组，词字符段保留整词，其余字符视为分隔，输出按
-- （CJK 段序号, 段内序：单字/词 < 二元组 < 段后词, 字符位置）排序），仅把数据源改为
-- documents.path 一列。分类细节与 0002 相同：个别罕见符号的分类可能与 Go 版不同
-- （只影响存量行的索引文本，整库重写后即以 Go 版为准）。
